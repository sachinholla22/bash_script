In Linux , the file system is organized into various folders that have specific purpose.

/(Root):
The topmost folder .Everything in the system is either in the root folder or inside subfolders of it.

/bin(Bineris):
Contains essential command binaries(programs) like ls ,cat ,cp ,mv etc..These commands are used by both users and system admins.

/usr:
Contains user-related programs and data.Its where you find most software installed on your system that isnt required for the system to run,
like applications ,libraies and other shared resources.Its often divided into subfolders like /usr/bin for bineries and /usr/lib for libraries..

/var:
Stands for "variable" and contains files that change frequently , like logs,cache files or databses..
For eg, /var/log stores system logs and /var/tmp stores temporary files that should persist even after a reboot.

/tmp:
Contains temporary files used by the system or applications.These files are often deleted when the system reboots.

/etc:
Contains configuratio files for the system and installed software.
For eg , it has the files like /etc/passwd for user account information.

/home:
Contains the personal directories for the users.For eg ,/home/username stores files,documents and configurations  specific to each user.


/sys:
A virtual file system that provides information and control over the kernal and system devices.Its not used for regular files but for interaction with system hardware

/dev :

/lib: 
Contains libraries needed by programs in /bin and /usr/bin to function.These liraries provide core functionality to the software.
